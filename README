#### Differential brain mechanisms of selection and maintenance of information during working memory

Note: One participant didn't sign a sharing data agreement so data of 22 participants are available here (vs. 23 in the manuscript). Results and conclusion are not different with only 22 participants.

Participant folder are organized as:
- ##### 'ses-mri/anat':
contains T1 MRI of the participant
- ##### ses-01:
contains MEG data in BIDS format, behavioral data and HPI position in surface RAS MRI coordinates for session 1
- ##### ses-02:
contains MEG data in BIDS format, behavioral data and HPI position in surface RAS MRI coordinates for session 2

##### Description of non-MEG files:
- ##### behavioral task scripts:
Matlab (psychtoolbox 3) script for Working Memory (WorkMem) and one-back control task (LocaCue)
- ##### hpi_mri_surf.txt:
Contains the X, Y Z coordinates of the nasion, left and right HPI (head position indicator) in surface MRI coordinates. Names of the electrode are NEC (nasion), LEC (left) and REC (right). Others coordinates are for co-registration during the session (not useful here). These HPI coordinates have been acquired from the neuronavigation system brainsight (https://www.rogue-research.com/tms/brainsight-tms/)
- ##### WorkMem+subNumber+date.csv:
